This a tip calculator for when dining in america, I made this to practice integrating 
Javascript into HMTL sites.

Possible Improvements
-Layout/Design - Currently very basic
-Calculate tax per person
-Calculate tax per group e.g add a new group or new single to the total
-Have different tabs for different countries that tip.
